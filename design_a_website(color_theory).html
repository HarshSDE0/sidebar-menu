<!-- Basic design principle
Design principles are the fundamental rules that guide the design process. 
They are the underlying guidelines that help designers
create effective, aesthetically pleasing, and user-friendly designs.
Here are some basic design principles:
1. **Balance**: The arrangement of visual elements to create a sense of stability and harmony.
2. **Proximity**: The placement of related elements close together to create a clear relationship between them
3. **Alignment**: The placement of elements along a line or axis to create a sense of order
4. **Repetition**: The use of similar elements, such as typography, color, or imagery
5. **Contrast**: The use of different visual elements, such as color, size, or 
shape, to create visual interest
6. **Emphasis**: The use of visual elements to draw attention to a particular part of the
design
7. **Movement**: The use of visual elements to create a sense of motion or direction
8. **Pattern**: The use of repetitive elements, such as texture or shape, to create a
visual rhythm
9. **Unity**: The use of visual elements to create a sense of oneness or cohesion
10. **Variety**: The use of different visual elements to create visual interest and
avoid boredom
11. **Hierarchy**: The use of size, color, and placement to create a clear order of
importance
12. **Typography**: The use of type faces, font sizes, font style, and line spacing to create a
visual communication
13. **Color**: The use of color to create mood, contrast, and harmony
14. **Texture**: The use of texture to create a tactile experience and add depth
to the design
15. **Space**: The use of positive and negative space to create a sense of
breathing room and visual balance
These principles are not mutually exclusive, and a good design often employs
 a combination of several principles to create

 COLOR theory
 Primary color : red, yellow, blue
 secondary colors are formed of mixture of primary colors
 primary and secondary colors mixtures provides tertiary color
 1) warm color : red, orange, yellow
 2) cool color : blue, green, purple
 3) neutral color : black, white, gray
 4) monochromatic color : different shades of same color
               In this we use combination of same color shades
 (subtle color combo)
 5) analogous color : colors that are next to each other on color wheel
 6) complementary color : colors that are opposite each other on color wheel
                              (Impactful color combo for highlight & marking 
                              important)
7) triadic color : colors that are equally spaced from each other on color wheel
               this combination is used to form hight contrast combo
               e.g: combo of red, blue, green
8) split complementary color : color and two colors on either side of its
               complementary color

We can visit "canvas color wheel" on google for getting monochromatic
analogous, complementary, triadic, split complementary color combination 



 COLOR wheel
 1) primary color : red, yellow, blue
 2) secondary color : vioilet,green, orange
 3) tertiary color : yellow-green, blue-green, blue-violet, red-violet, red-orange
                              yellow-orange

Every color have some meaning
list is shown as picture

NOTE : for using any color for particular element first categorize
that element example
if we want to symbolize food - it is related to health. so, use green color
if we want to symbolize technology - it is related to innovation. so, use blue color
if we want to symbolize love - it is related to passion. so, use red color
if we want to symbolize nature - it is related to freshness. so, use green color
if we want to symbolize luxury - it is related to wealth. so, use gold color or 
                              black grey & white mixture 
if we want to symbolize finance - use blue
if we want to symbolize entertainment or hungriness - use combo of red & orange

TYPOGRAPHY:
STYLE & APPEARANCE OF TEXT
BY STYLE WE MEAN : color, font-style, font-size 

Below is the example of typography
jitna important hmara color hota hai utni hi important hmari typography hoti hai

Every font-style(style in which it is written + it's color) convey some meaning

text with same font-family but different color conveys different meaning
like for portfolio we will use some proffesional font-style
like for blog we will use some casual font-style
like for news we will use some formal font-style
like for children we will use some playful font-style
like for selling ice-cream use some fun font-style
like for selling medicine use some serious font-style
like for museum we will sue some historic representaional, seriousness font-style

Different font-families
1) sans-serif
2) serif
3) monospace
4) cursive
5)fantasy
etc

These font-families are group of font-styles with same characteristics


ON a website there are various sections 
like header, main, footer, aside 
in every section we can only use 2 font-styles
& in a webpage proffesionalism must be maitained so prefer minimal change of font-family



GOOGLE FONTS(library of fonts, in which there are many free fonts)
used to set typography
visit : https://fonts.google.com

for using particular style 
step 1 : click on embed code
step 2 : there are several options where to use those fonts
step 3 : copy the link tag and paste it in head tag of html file
step 4 : use the font-family in css file
